## Websocket-chat

This is a quick websocket practice as a simple chat room with Vue and Bulma.

## Get Started

At first, you should have node.js in your machine, and...

run `yarn install` to install dependencies in the project, such as express, nodemon, and socket.io.

Finally, run `nodemon index.js`, then you can open your browser on localhost:4000 to see the demo and chat with yourself.

Have a fun!
